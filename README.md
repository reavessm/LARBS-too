# Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts for Gentoo (LARBS-too)


## Installation:

On an Gentoo based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reavessm/LARBS-too/master/larbs.sh
bash larbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is LARBS-too?

This is a fork of [Lukes Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) that works for Gentoo.  This will also have my personalized dot files and packages for [ROS](https://github.com/reavessm/ros).
